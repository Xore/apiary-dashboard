// Wire shapes of the backend's event rows, shared by every slice that lists
// events. Typed from the Rust structs in backend-service: src/events.rs
// (EventRow, EventPivots, CorrelatedIp, EventsPage, row_from_source,
// row_from_hit, pivots_from_source). Snake_case as on the wire.
//
// #75 builds on this file, as do the Monitor pages: /api/v1/events is the
// endpoint behind the overview's recent-activity list as well as the
// sessions and IP-profile drill-downs, so the row shape is deliberately
// here rather than in any one slice's contract.
//
// Every String field the backend builds with `unwrap_or("")` arrives as ""
// when the source document lacks it, so "" means "absent" throughout — the
// one exception is `id`, which is `#[serde(default)]` (present, but "").
//
// These are all backend-built structs with every field set on every path,
// so nothing here is optional. That is the opposite of the store rows in
// ./monitor, which are raw `_source` documents written by the workers.
