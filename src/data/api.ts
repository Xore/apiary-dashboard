// The real backend behind the events & sessions slice (#75): the APIARY
// Rust tier (backend-service), fetched over the same shared service token
// this tier already presents on /metrics, and mapped with the adapters that
// shipped in #167. Server-only; the browser never loads it.
//
// The mock stays the default. `runForRequest` (src/data/backend.ts) routes
// here only when the page carries no `?mock=` AND this process has
// BACKEND_URL set; every mock scenario, and every query this module does
// not implement, still answers from the mock — which is what keeps the ten
// scenarios and the browser checks working.
//
// Base URL and token: the same two variables the canonical BFF reads
// (frontend-next/src/lib/backend.server.ts `backendURL()` and the
// `x-service-token` header), so one deployment configures both tiers.
// BACKEND_URL is also the opt-in: unset means "this tier talks to nobody",
// which is the default. The token is never logged, never in a URL, and
// never in an error message — it only ever rides as a request header.

 * (the adapter owns the precedence), and `open` in `/stats` is an ALL-TIME
 * backlog — that total minus every dispositioned ∪ acknowledged id — not a
 * 24-hour figure, which is why it feeds its own labelled tile.
 *
 * GAP: `total24h` and the three breakdowns the page computes over them
 * (`bySeverity`, `topSources`, `eventTypes`) need a WINDOWED store query.
 * `/api/v1/store/ml-anomalies` accepts only `offset`, `size` and `q` — a
 * Lucene query string, which is how the canonical page asks for the window
 * (two paged reads, `q: @timestamp:[now-24h TO now]`). Those reads are not
 * made here: the window would have to be spelled as a Lucene range in a query
 * string this seam otherwise passes through untouched, and the two reads cost
 * twice what one does. So against live data the "last 24h" tile and the three
 * breakdowns it feeds are zero, while the rows themselves, the backlog and the
 * model health are real. The rows are the page's own list — they are not
 * filtered, and the page's `N of M anomalies` count is honest.
 *
 * `scoreTimeline` needs `/api/v1/charts/ml-anomaly-scores` (charts.rs
 * `ml_anomaly_scores`, L847), a chart the proxy route in #82 already serves
 * to the browser but not through this seam — it is read here rather than left
 * fabricated, because the rows it returns are the same `composite_score` and
 * `model_scores` the anomaly rows already carry and the page's chart is one
 * panel of one view. */

/** This slice's queries, and nothing else. Each keeps the mock
 * implementation's signature exactly — `queries.ts` is generated from it and
 * pages are typed against it.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and the reason is the one thing in this slice worth
 * reading before changing anything:
 *
 * - `getPreferences` — a PUBLIC_QUERY (authorize.ts:9). The navigation guard
 *   resolves it on every navigation and the sign-in pages render with it, so
 *   it runs BEFORE sign-in. The real `GET /api/v1/preferences` needs the
 *   service token AND a subject: an empty subject is a 400 (preferences.rs
 *   `subject` validation). A pre-sign-in call has no subject, so wiring it
 *   turns the sign-in page into a 400 on every load — the deadlock the task
 *   brief names. Canonical does not reach the backend here either: it builds
 *   the pre-session values from its own process environment. So this leaves
 *   it, and both `savePreferences` with it, on the mock. Wiring one half of
 *   the pair is worse than wiring neither — the pane would save to one store
 *   and render from another.
 *
 * - `savePreferences` — same document, same reason. `PUT
 *   /api/v1/preferences` merges a `deny_unknown_fields` patch, so it can be
 *   wired without the read; it is not, because it would then write the wire
 *   while `getPreferences` renders the mock.
 *
 * - `getAttackers` / `getSourceHealth` — other slices' work.
 *
 * - `previewReport` — reports' own gap: the backend renders a report, it does
 *   not preview a draft, and there is no `/reports/preview` route. The
 *   wizard's review step therefore stays mock-derived while the live tier is
 *   set — real counts and a real PDF, but the two disagree. The other half
 *   of the reports gap list (`sandbox-runs` / payload search for the artifact
 *   pickers) is in contracts/reports.ts, typed and deliberately unadapted: no
 *   page type exists to adapt them to.
 *
 * - `getFacets` — no endpoint at all: filter-values serves keys only, with
 *   no counts, and the events slice's read of it is why the counts are gone.
 *
 * - `getSourceIdentity` / `getSourceNetwork` / `getAsn` / `getIdentity` /
 *   `getCampaign` / `getBlockedIps` — page types whose membership the
 *   endpoints above answer but whose shape needs a member set nothing
 *   serves: `investigate/cluster` 404s a cluster of fewer than two members
 *   and `investigate/cidr` returns no address list at all (its group is
 *   folded from the records it does return, as `getNetwork`'s comment says).
 *   `getBlockedIps` is the export route's own job (`ip-block-export`), not
 *   a list endpoint — see downloads.ts.
 *
 * Gaps that are wired anyway, and why, are in the slice's own tests: the
 * lossy scope filters, the scope keys with no page field, `schedule.enabled`
 * and `schedule.failures`, the wire fields the page types do not carry, and
 * the `{ deleted }` responses nothing adapts. */
