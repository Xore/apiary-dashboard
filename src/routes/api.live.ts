// GET /api/live — the live event stream, as Server-Sent Events: one `data:`
// line per new event (JSON), an `event: health` when source health changes,
// and a comment every 15 s so proxies keep the connection. Fed by the mock
// backend's generator when the page is in a `?mock=` scenario, and proxied
// off the Rust tier's own /api/v1/live when this process has a BACKEND_URL
// and the request carries no scenario.
//
// THE GATE (#82). `streams.admit()` sits directly above the branch, so it
// covers BOTH arms: the mock generator and the upstream fetch. That is the
// point of moving it here — an SSE connection holds its slot for as long as
// the browser stays on the page, so a proxy in front of the real stream
// with no gate is an unbounded fan-in on the backend, and shedding would
// only ever have applied to the mock it replaces. One gate, one counter: a
// shed on either arm is counted the same way on /metrics
// (`bff_sheds_total{reason}`). The slot is held for the life of the stream
// and released exactly once — on close, on client disconnect, and on an
// upstream that ends first.
//
// No `AbortSignal.timeout` on the upstream fetch: the stream is long-lived by
// design, so the only signal is the request's own abort, which is what stops
// the upstream connection when the operator navigates away.

/** One upstream frame, in the framing this tier's browser client reads.

 *   `.event("event")`), and a NAMED event does not fire `onmessage`, which
 *   is the only listener src/data/liveStream.ts registers. Forwarding the
 *   name would leave the browser receiving a live stream it silently never
 *   reads — the same failure as serving the wrong chart, one layer down.
 *   The unnamed default event is what the mock arm already sends.
 * - `data:` is mapped through the same `pageEvent` the JSON path applies,
 *   because upstream sends an `events.rs` `row_from_hit` document and every
 *   consumer of a live event here holds a `HoneypotEvent`
 *   (EventNotifications reads `severity`/`summary`/`srcIp`, which the wire
 *   row does not carry under those names). Relaying raw rows would hand
 *   those pages `undefined` fields instead of a connection.
 *
 * Comments, `retry:`, and any other named event (`health` from the mock arm)
 * are passed through untouched — there is nothing to map on a comment, and
 * `health` is this tier's own event name, not the Rust tier's. */
