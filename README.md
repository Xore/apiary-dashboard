# APIARY Dashboard Rewrite

Clean-room dashboard rewrite using TanStack Start, Bun, and Astryx.

Planning and progress:

- [Implementation epic](https://github.com/Xore/apiary-dashboard/issues/1)
- [Upstream APIARY epic](https://github.com/Xore/APIARY/issues/3279)
- [Canonical running implementation](https://github.com/Xore/APIARY/tree/main/arcane/home/honeypot-dashboard/frontend-next)

The canonical implementation is a behavioral reference, not a component source to copy mechanically. Every migration slice must trace its routes, data, actions, security, and states before being rebuilt with current TanStack and Astryx conventions.

Current stage: the dashboard runs on its real architecture against a **mock backend**. Every page reads and writes through server functions, behind the same session and security layer production will use. Wiring the real backend replaces what answers behind the server functions, per route slice (#6); the pages don't change.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run dev          # vite dev server on 0.0.0.0:3009, usable from the LAN (development settings)
bunx tsc --noEmit    # typecheck
bun run lint
bun run test
bun run build        # production build into dist/
SERVICE_TOKEN=… bun run start   # Bun production server (server.ts)
bun run smoke        # clean clone → install → every gate → start → HTTP and browser checks
```

### Design studio

`bun run studio` builds `design-studio/index.html`: every Astryx component the dashboard uses, rendered with the real themes (palette, light/dark and contrast switch in its toolbar), in one self-contained file that opens from disk. Each component lists variants: **A** is the current decision recorded in `DESIGN.md`; add **B**, **C**… in `design-studio/specimens.tsx` to compare alternatives side by side. `PRODUCT.md` and `DESIGN.md` hold the product and visual decisions; Astryx's own guidelines (`AGENTS.md`, `bunx astryx docs`) come first.

### CI and the container image

GitHub Actions, on GitHub-hosted runners:

| Workflow | When | What |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | every pull request, pushes to main | public-repository safety (`scripts/check-public-leaks.ts`: no secrets, no real deployment addresses, mock data in documentation ranges only); typecheck, lint, tests, theme and generated-file freshness, build; the release gate `scripts/smoke.sh` with the runner's Chrome; `actionlint` over the workflows |
| `container.yml` | every pull request, pushes to main, `v*` tags | builds the `Dockerfile`, checks the image refuses to boot without `SERVICE_TOKEN` and serves once given one, scans it with Trivy (critical, fixable); on main and tags pushes it to `ghcr.io/xore/apiary-dashboard` (`latest`, `sha-…`, the tag) with an SBOM and a signed provenance attestation (`gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/xore/apiary-dashboard:latest --owner Xore`). Nothing deploys it yet. |
| `codeql.yml` | pull requests, main, weekly | CodeQL `security-extended` over the TypeScript |
| `dependency-review.yml` | pull requests | fails on a new dependency with a moderate or worse advisory |
| `pr-title.yml` | pull requests | the title is a conventional commit (it becomes the squash commit), and its kind sets the release-notes label |
| `release.yml` | `v*` tags | a GitHub Release with notes from the merged pull requests, and the production build as a tarball with a build-provenance attestation; `container.yml` pushes the image for the same tag |
| `scorecard.yml` | main, weekly | OpenSSF Scorecard supply-chain checks, into the Security tab |
| `code-review.yml` | pull requests | an automated review (Claude Code action) with inline comments; skips unless a `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret is set; advisory only |
| `assistant.yml` | `@claude` in a comment | answers or makes the change on a branch; owner and collaborators only |
| `bun-update.yml` | weekly (Monday) and on demand | `bun update` within package.json ranges; opens or refreshes one PR from `deps/bun-update`. With a `DEPS_PR_TOKEN` secret (fine-grained, this repository, Contents + Pull requests read/write) the PR runs the required checks; without it, checks need a push to the branch |
| `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` | Dependabot PRs | patch and minor updates merge once every required check is green; majors and 0.x minors wait for a person |

Dependabot proposes GitHub Actions and base-image updates weekly. It cannot read Bun 1.4's `bun.lock` yet, so npm packages come from `bun-update.yml` instead; TanStack packages are pinned to exact versions and move together. A ruleset on `main` requires every check above except the automated review, and blocks force pushes and deletion.

To release: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`.

```bash
docker build -t apiary-dashboard .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e SERVICE_TOKEN=… apiary-dashboard
```

`bun run test` covers the authorization matrix, the boot policies, sessions, nav roll-ups, formatters, and invariants over the mock backend: numbers shown on different pages must agree, and every id one page links to must resolve on its target page.

### Signing in and security

Every page needs a session. Signing in goes through the mock identity provider at `/auth/login`: pick **Operator** (admin) or **Analyst** (viewer). Production puts Keycloak with PKCE in its place (#5). The session is real:
- an opaque id in the `__Host-apiary_bff` cookie (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax, 12 h);
- the identity behind it in a session store, kept in the server's memory until Redis takes over, so a restart or a code reload in dev signs everyone out.

On the server:
- every server function passes a **same-origin check** (a cross-site state-changing call gets 403);
- every query is **authorized for the caller**: no session → 401; a viewer calling an admin-only write → 403; the canonical permissions are in `src/server/authorize.ts`;
- direct handlers (`/api/*`) check the session themselves; `/healthz` and the firewall's blocklist export are deliberately public;
- `/auth/logout` needs a same-origin Origin or Referer, then destroys the session.

The server refuses to boot in an environment that would open it:

| Variable | |
|---|---|
| `SERVICE_TOKEN` | Shared secret with the backend. Required, unless `APIARY_ALLOW_UNAUTH_DEV=1` says this is a local instance (`E-SERVICE-TOKEN`). |
| `APIARY_ALLOW_UNAUTH_DEV` | Exactly `1`: a local development instance. `bun run dev` sets it. |
| `OIDC_DISABLED` | `1` skips sign-in: everyone is a fixture admin. Only with `NODE_ENV=development` or `APIARY_ALLOW_UNAUTH_DEV=1` (`E-OIDC-DISABLED`). |
| `APIARY_DEV_HTTP_COOKIE` | Exactly `1`: the session cookie works over plain HTTP (`apiary_bff_dev`, not Secure), so a dev server can be used from another machine by its LAN address. Only with `NODE_ENV=development` or `APIARY_ALLOW_UNAUTH_DEV=1` (`E-DEV-HTTP-COOKIE`). `bun run dev` sets it and listens on 0.0.0.0. |
| `EXTERNAL_URL` | The public origin, when a proxy in front changes the Host the server sees (same-origin check). |
| `APIARY_MOCK_FAULTS` | Mock only: `session-store` and/or `identity-provider` (comma-separated) stop answering, to exercise the outage paths. Pages then go to sign-in, direct handlers answer 401, and the sign-in pages say sign-in is unavailable or failed; smoke checks both. |

See `.env.example`.

### Mock data

The mock backend (`src/data/queries.impl.ts`, fixtures in `src/data/mock/`) runs on the server only: the browser bundle has none of it. `src/data/queries.ts` is generated by `scripts/gen-queries.ts` and holds one server function per query. After adding or renaming a query, run `bun scripts/gen-queries.ts`; a test fails when the file is stale.

Mock writes (acknowledge, block, save, mint, …) change the server's in-memory state, so every page, tab and download sees them. A server restart starts from the fixtures again.

**Scenarios** make the whole backend behave a given way, so every page's empty, error, loading and role-limited states can be seen. Pick one from the **Mock data** button in the top bar, or add `?mock=<scenario>` to any URL; it sticks while you navigate. The scenario travels with each call, so two tabs in different scenarios don't affect each other.

| `?mock=` | What the backend does |
|---|---|
| `empty` | No data yet: every list empty, every count zero (catalogs and KPI tiles stay, at zero) |
| `large` | A busy deployment: six-digit counts, long lists, long values, any page of them |
| `slow` | Every call takes 2.5 s: pending skeletons |
| `partial` | The same third of the reads fail with 502 on every visit; the rest answer |
| `unavailable` | Every call fails with 502 |
| `overloaded` | Every call is shed with 503 and Retry-After: 30 |
| `expired` | Every call answers 401: session expired |
| `viewer` | The signed-in operator acts as a viewer: admin actions are disabled and refused with 403 |

**Live data:** `/api/live` streams new events as Server-Sent Events while the dashboard is open, in the fleet's proportions, from one generator on the server. The Event explorer and the overview follow it. The **Live** badge in the top bar pauses and resumes every refresh path (the choice is kept in this browser) and turns **Stalled** when the stream breaks.

**Chart and topology payloads:** `/api/chart/{name}` (the 21 allowlisted charts) and `/api/topology/flow` answer in the Rust tier's wire shapes, typed in `src/data/contracts/charts.ts`, built from the same mock data and scenarios the pages read. They are what production's proxies pass through, for the operational checks that call them; the pages themselves read through server functions.

The same menu can **simulate an incident** to see the operational toasts raise and resolve: a sensor goes silent, ingest stalls, the cluster goes red, Filebeat drops, dead letters arrive, or everything recovers. Every open tab hears it through the stream.

`bun scripts/crawl.ts <url> 1 --scenarios` signs in, opens one page of every route shape under each scenario, and fails on a page that crashes or shows the wrong state; smoke runs it.

```bash
VITE_MOCK_LATENCY_MS=800 bun run dev   # extra latency on every call, any scenario
VITE_MOCK_FAIL=1 bun run dev           # every call fails, without a scenario
```

In dev, TanStack devtools open with **Ctrl+~** (the floating trigger is hidden so it never covers page actions).

## Stack notes

- Routing: TanStack Router file routes in `src/routes/`; `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated.
- UI: Astryx components (see `AGENTS.md` for the CLI workflow — `bunx astryx build "<idea>"`).
- Theme: editable neutral theme family in `src/themes/neutral/`. `neutralTheme.ts` is the root (the annotated `theme.template.ts` documents every field); `variants/*.ts` hold one family member each: one of APIARY's nine palettes (Settings → Appearance → Palette; Claude is the default) and a high-contrast twin of every palette (`*-hc.ts`), built from the helpers in `neutralVariants.ts`. A palette is a whole theme, as in APIARY: ground, chrome, surface ramp, borders, text ramp, accent family and status tones all come from it; typography, shape, motion and chart series stay the neutral ones. Settings also offers Astryx's own themes (`src/themes/astryx/<name>`, scaffolded with `bunx astryx theme add <name>`: neutral, butter, chocolate, gothic, matcha, stone, y2k) as whole designs with their own fonts, shapes and Lucide icons; they have no high-contrast twin, and their fonts, like the neutral family's, are self-hosted from `@fontsource` (imported in `styles.css`). `src/themes/appTheme.ts` maps the preferences to a member; the root route passes it to `<Theme>`, so the server renders the chosen theme and there is no flash. Then:

  ```bash
  bun run theme:build   # regenerates neutral-family.css / .js / .d.ts (every member, one stylesheet)
  bun run theme:check   # fails if the committed outputs are stale (part of smoke)
  ```

  The theme CLI runs under Bun (`bunx --bun`, with `JITI_TRY_NATIVE=0` so the family build can trace each member's ancestry) and `icons.tsx` carries a `@jsxRuntime automatic` pragma for the same loader. A new member is a new file in `variants/`, picked up by the build's glob, plus an entry in `appTheme.ts`. The palettes' values are APIARY's, imported from its vendored Xore/theme stylesheet by `scripts/import-apiary-palettes.py <APIARY checkout>` into `apiaryPalettes.generated.ts` (change them in Xore/theme, then re-import and `bun run theme:build`); `neutralVariants.ts` maps APIARY's roles onto Astryx tokens. The neutral base's own hues start from `palette.config.json` via `bunx astryx theme palette generate <config> -o <name>.generated.ts -f`.
